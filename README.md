# Return Journey Assignment

This is a repo containing the solution for the backend assignments.

## Tasks Description

### 1. Tasks 1-3

#### Task 1

Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of integers as input and returns a new array containing
only the unique elements in the original array, without using any built-in functions for this purpose (e.g.,
Set).

#### Task 2

Create a JavaScript object representing a car with properties like brand, model, and year. Write a function
that takes two car objects as input and merges them into a new object, preserving the properties from
both.

#### Task 3

Write a function that takes two arrays of integers and returns a new array containing the common
elements between the two arrays, without using any built-in functions for this purpose.

### 2. Tasks 4-7

#### Task 4

Design and implement a simple RESTful API using Node.js and TypeScript. The API should have the
following endpoints:

- GET /api/products: Retrieve a list of products.
- GET /api/products/:id: Retrieve details of a specific product by ID.
- POST /api/products: Create a new product.
- PUT /api/products/:id: Update details of a specific product by ID.
- DELETE /api/products/:id: Delete a product by ID.
Use an in-memory data store (e.g., an array) to store the product data.

#### Task 5

Create a middleware function that logs the timestamp, HTTP method, and requested URL for every
incoming request to the API.

#### Task 6

Write unit tests for at least two API endpoints using a testing framework of your choice (e.g., Jest). Ensure
that the tests cover different scenarios, including success cases and error handling.

#### Task 7

Provide comprehensive documentation for your API, including instructions on how to run the server
locally, the list of available endpoints, and example requests and responses.
